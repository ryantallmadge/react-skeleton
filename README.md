REACT SKELETON!
This repo is ment to give you the starting point for your react app. Cloning this repo into your project will give you a head start as I have done all the leg work to get you up and running. You will need a few things first before cloning this repo.
The first thing you will need is npm. If using a mac, which you should be, and have not installed homebrew, do it now: http://brew.sh/
